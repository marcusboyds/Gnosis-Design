# Bringing Gnosis Safe to Surface With Design
## With digital assets having value, the Internet turns the first place where you should show what you are protecting because they make it really safe.

Everything begins in the Codless Conduct, a Hackathon hosted on Gitcoin for anyone who wants to use their good abilities outside coding to learn and earn from web3. 

And between the Bounties, where enterprises and companies put objectives to we accomplish, I found the better for me, and of course, it was design.

# Gnosis Safe Design Exploration
And the company is called Gnosis Safe. Intuitively name and business are the same here, it's a digital asset safe where you can have more security than holding in your own MetaMesk, for example.

They have an entire system running now, where you can see your assets, check your tokens, create safes, and a lot of functions that agree with all the site promise.

But in this Bounty, they were asking for something new, just like the title says: Design Exploration.

## Looking for Problems

To start let's create a problem statement to help us clearly define the user pain points that our future designs can address.

So I needed to search for anything that brings me a big opportunity to design an improvement, just like the bounty asked. So for that, I just went to the site, and at the 3 first minutes of exploration, quickly I've already realized the great statement.

"We can't admire public digital assets in any safe"

This sentence turned the master key to a new improvement, and within this scenario where we can admire public digital assets in any safe, other statements of User Experiences come together.

**1. The Communication is niched:** you and I who are used to web3 will digest the site in a few seconds and understand what it is about, but a good portion of the curious who are entering now may give up understanding in the first 30 seconds.

**2. Brand visuals not applied yet:** Gnosis Safe has one the best motion graphics videos I have ever seen in web3, but most part of their visual identity of them is not applied on the site.

**3. Only work on the app:** the way to the entire business work is through the application. An only way-stream on the company can be good for early establishments, but a for a medium and long-term is better to diversification the products.

## Defining the Way
With 3 problem statements in hand, we just need now to decide which way we're going to solve them. And I quickly decided on the best options:
"A dApp where I can admire, save and share the best digital assets in the world"

**1. Make communication intuitive:** so as not to scare off early adopters, the initial communication on the site will be much friendlier and not so businesslike. The user will feel that he has seen these types of vaults elsewhere.

**2. Build on the visual identity:** take inspiration from and use the graphic elements used in the intro video throughout the new design. Making Gnosis without feeling well through abstract shapes and their beautiful gradients.

**3. Create a new public stream:** the application will continue to work, but now curious people who are entering web3 will now be able to enjoy themselves as observers, without having to create a single wallet or safe.

---

This whole path was designed so that Gnosis Safe has an important spread now at the birth of web3. New users will stay interested in this digital asset's show until it spreads well in a way that snowballs like Foundation, Open Sea, Rarible, and other NFT Apps.

And another very important thing, in this version an intern market has not yet been implemented on the site, that is, I cannot sell or buy assets within Gnosis.

# Design
## Ideating

UX Powerful weapons are already loaded. Let's ideate these solutions in a new feature at the Gnosis Safe website.
To support all the points I needed to allocate a series of necessary main pages on the site for all the exploration to make sense, so I put:
- **Home:** where the curious people will arrive and be stuck with beautiful and very expensive assets organizations showed publicly by DAOs and safe owners. 
- **Assets:** a unique page built for each asset, they can divide into 4 types (art, character, music, and video)
- **Collections:** what would be the world without NFT Collections pages.
- **Safes:** the best chance to show you power within web3, nothing is more hype than a very rich publicly safe.
- **Profile:** the need to individuality rapidly pull-ups with the flexing evolving NFT Ownership, so the new improvement needed a DAO profile and Normal User profile.
- **Cinema Mode:** for visual addicts, this is the best feature of all, a completely immersive experience to watch and go through the beauty and expense of all.

But before we shoot it as stunning interfaces, let's gatherer some references to enhance our creativity and anticipate our thinking.

## Construction

Phew, finally now we can construct!

I use Figma to pass the idea to the paper in the best shape humankind invented until now. Suddenly our creative journey written ends here because what happens in Figma stays there, it's so difficult to write my mind on what's going on there, but I hope someday I could do it. 

So let's check out the finalization of all those concepts with prototyping.

# Result
In a very practical way, come with me and play with some user flow hypotheses.

## Just Walking Around
## Found Someone That I Know
## Check Collection I've Heard About
## Seeing The Biggest Digital Asset Safe in The World
## Eat Some Brownies and Now I'm Tripping Hard With NFTs

Now we've seen the how the site does work, check it out technacily all those parts, using the same page order I've cited before

## Home
**Hero:** We start at home with a simple and shiny hero to bring atenction to ownsership and blockchain assets. Having 2 main call-to-actions, start experience and create a safe. Put 3 pitch cards to tell the Gnosis Safe relevance in market.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73398891/157480441-28f8ed82-53e9-4f57-886a-723f46736dd9.png)

And scrolling just a little bit down we can already reach the entire UX Solution, the show of assets, they're divided in som

**Trending Assets**: unique pieces separately from the all
**Famous Collections:** the most hold collections at the Gnosis' Safes
**Biggest Safes:** the main attraction for every digital collector and curious too see what it's about.

To less emotional people we have the list show too!

**Recent Profiles:** important organizations and people who highlight at the week![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73398891/157480879-189cbe60-6ae1-405f-bb90-8c51efd53554.png)

**Footer:** this is not exclusively from home, but will put it here.

## Assets
This is the default for every asset page

For a better design and organization, we have assets in main 4 types, just like programming languages. They only differentiate at proprieties.

Art:

Giving life and nature to all those types.

## Collections
**Hero**: Where we have the collection splash and all the main information, like quantity of assets, the main type and total volume acquired and the safes where appears the collection.

**Body**: Where you can check all the assets, and others complementary info like description, minted chain, artist, trade history and more of the safes.

**Related Content**: For mainting the user at the navigation flow, we use the related and recommended contet to he keep hours looking for something.

## Safes
**Hero**: The main of the main, here we show as aspects of a Safe hold in Gnosis Safe. Value acquired, how much collections and assets too. And show the princiapal owners of the safe.

**Body**: Where you can check all the assets, and others complementary info like description, minted chain, artist, trade history and a list of principal owners too.

## Cinema Mode

For a better apreciation a cinema mode was made to people really see the beauty and the value of all assets inside Gnosis. We contain the same components of the normal mode, as names
